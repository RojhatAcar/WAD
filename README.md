# WAD
Creating a Django website
- The API used for displaying the image locations is:

- [MapBox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs)

Additional resources:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)
- [Promise.js](https://www.promisejs.org/)

This project was completed by myself and a friend for our final assignment for WAD--> web application development.
This app works similar to Instagram in that it allows users to register(including changing password changing profile picture etc) make a post(which can be tied to a certain location using the Mapbox API) with a designated comments section and a like/dislike feature. This also had an ability to search for photos based on their catagory (animals, nauture ,cars etc). I throuoghly enjoyed this project espically being able to work in a small team for the first time!
